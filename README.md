# Windows 10 (Pro ?) - disable the reminders about upgrading to Windows 11
A batch file and a file with couple of Windows registry settings for turning off the reminders about upgrading to Windows 11.

For the steps on how to implement those changes, please [this article](https://yannek.pro/tips-and-tricks/disable-windows-upgrade-from-10-to-11)

Tested just in Windows 10 `Pro` (I think it should work in the `Home` edition either).
