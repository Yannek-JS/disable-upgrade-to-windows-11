# Windows 10 (Pro ?) - disable the reminders about upgrading to Windows 11
A batch file and a file with couple of Windows registry settings for turning off the reminders about upgrading to Windows 11. For better convenience both put into archive file in the `download` directory.

Tested just in Windows 10 Pro (I think it should work in the `Home` edition either).
